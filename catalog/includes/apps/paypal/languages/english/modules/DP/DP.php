module_dp_introduction = <ul>
  <li>Direct Payment lets you design and host your own checkout pages.</li>
  <li>You keep your customers on your site instead of having them pay on PayPal; PayPal remains invisible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Direct Payment enables buyers to pay by credit or debit card during your checkout flow. You have complete control over the experience; however, you must consider PCI compliance.</p>
<p>Please note: Direct Payment is not a stand-alone product - you are required to enable and use Express Checkout together with Direct Payment.</p>
